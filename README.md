Sudoku Solver
=============

This is a small project performed to get an initial use of interfaces with Python. 
It uses the Tkinter module. Therefore, tkinter must be installed in order to work.

The main code is a recursion function that is going to solve a sudoku board. Then the idea
was to populate the board with tkinter and find the solution. It is important to acknowledge
that solving a sudoku board is a recursion idea that was not created by myself, there is a plethora
of people that have done it as well. 

It was a fun project tho. :D
